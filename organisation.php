<p>Student Volunteer Connections receives $1.25 from each undergraduate student and $1.08 from each graduate student. Therefore, SVC is primarily student funded and operated.
<p>The SVC Board of Directors (BoD) ensures that the organisation is accountable to its members. The board is primarily involved with the operations and finance of the organisation, from hiring, to budget approval, and providing support to the staff. Support is provided by leadership, service, and involvement programs. The board consists of all volunteer positions and is made up of both appointed and elected representatives. The BoD also approves all Student Volunteer Grants (SVG's) for individuals, organisations, and events.</p>
<p>Each year SVC holds an annual general meeting for all members. All <em>University of Guelph</em> Undergraduate and Graduate students are members of SVC. The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is where the most important decisions are made, including election of the undergraduate and graduate board members. All students are welcome to attend both the AGM and the regular monthly board of directors meetings.</p>
<p>The CSA and GSA appoint associate members and the other members are appointed internally by the board.</p>
