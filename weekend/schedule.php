                                <p>2013 is the year of "Growing Capacity for Change". Brigette DePape, Dave Meslin and Heather Jarvis have all been incredibly successful in working towards positive change. Using their diverse experiences, the panelists will launch the conference addressing many of the questions that Do So Much strives to answer including how to be innovative and incorporate creativity in your initiatives; the importance of collaboration; how to encourage people to connect with your cause and take action; and how we are all interconnected regardless of where our passion lies!</p>

                                <p>Want to learn how to better convey your message?  Whether as advocates or leaders, we sometimes don’t consider the perspectives of others, and remain rigid in our approach.  But we need people to connect with us in order to connect with the cause we are working towards.  This experiential workshop uses storytelling, personality psychology, and experiential exercises to help participants build skills they need to effectively communicate their message.  By practicing building a personal narrative, learning about and understanding their listener, and seeing problems from different perspectives, participants will learn to communicate in a way that better connects with their audience.</p>
