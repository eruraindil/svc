    <p class="lead">Ayanda Keith Dube is a student and advocate for refugee issues.</p>
    <p>He is currently involved with Mapping Memories "a collaborative media project which uses personal stories and a range of media tools (video, sound walks, mapping, photography) to better understand the experiences of youth with refugee experience in Montreal" (Mapping Memories).</p>
    <p>He has worked with the Canadian Council for Refugees on a number of campaigns which have taken
    us to Ottawa to lobby for the granting of permanent residence to non-status residents living in Canada
    for up to 10 years in limbo, while working on a BA double major in economics and political science with the hope of going to law
    school after completion of his undergraduate degree. Last year, he was chosen as a CBC Montrealer
    the Week for his work with Mapping Memories in the high schools of Montreal.</p>
    <p>He is a true believer that the young generation is where we can start to fix the worldâ€™s problems. If we as
    adults teach children to love everyone they come across, we would easily solve half the issues.</p>
