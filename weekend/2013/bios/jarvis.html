    <p class="lead">Heather Jarvis is a queer feminist activist.</p>
    <p>With experience in gender studies, social work
    and community activism she has spent several years supporting and initiating projects around
    sexuality, gender, education, stigma and health, anti-violence efforts and creating safer spaces
    for support. As a survivor, Jarvis was infuriated upon hearing a slut-shaming and victim-blaming
    comment made by a representative of the Toronto Police force when discussing safety. Having
    had enough, she co-founded SlutWalk in early 2011 - a small idea that began in Toronto to fight
    sexual violence and has since spread across the world.</p>

    <p>Identifying with sex- and body-positive politics Jarvis constantly aims to shed shame around sex,
    sexuality and the bodies we have. She has a fascination with language and identities and strives
    to utilize language to interrogate ideas and blend important conversations across oppression,
    privilege, desire and expression. Through her politics and her work she has become a speaker,
    advocate and educator. Described as an eternal optimist by some who know her, Jarvis refuses to
    believe things cannot change. She is determined to continuously work on improving this world
    through increased respect, consent, understanding and acceptance.</p>
