    <p class="lead">Georgia Simms, a U of G alumna, is a dance artist, choreographer and facilitation
    specialist who is passionate about doing democracy and governance differently.</p>
    <p>She is actively experimenting with arts-based approaches for civic engagement, and
    seeks to creatively animate learning processes with experiences that are physical,
    emotional and energetic. Her site-specific choreography, inspired by a strong desire
    to raise awareness about protecting water, has been presented Downtown Guelph
    around the St. George's fountain and in the water feature in Market Square.</p>

    <p>While always dedicated to the dance studio, Georgia is also drawn to the academic
    realm and completed her degrees in International Development and Geography
    with a focus on environmental governance. She also worked as a Research Associate
    with the Water Policy and Governance Group at the University of Waterloo. Finding
    frustration in traditional political institutions and looking for more transformative
    options for promoting sustainability, she decided to put her attention into the field
    of art for social change and opted to study briefly at the <em>International Centre for
    Art for Social Change</em> at Simon Fraser University. These experiences, paired with
    her ongoing apprenticeship with accomplished and socially-conscious modern
    dance artists at <em>Dancetheatre David Earle</em>, have inspired her investigations into the
    intersection of social science and arts practice. Her own creative enterprise, <em>IMAGEO
    artworks</em>, is a platform for this work.</p>
