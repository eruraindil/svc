    <p class="lead">Dave Meslin is an activist, journalist, community organizer and professional rabble-rouser with a focus
    on public space, voting reform and providing an antidote to apathy.</p>

    <p>With one foot planted firmly in the world of mainstream politics and the other foot dancing in the more
    vibrant universe of grassroots activism, Meslin has found ways to bring them both together and turn
    energy into action.</p>

    <p>Meslin's activism started with guerilla-style street antics. Painting bike lanes directly onto the street,
    altering billboards, and hanging pictures of Bill Cosby and Bill Clinton over "Post no Bills" signs were
    all part of his repertoire.</p>

    <p>He was named one of the Top 12 to Watch in 2012 by the <em>Toronto Star</em> for his actions to "make
    it easier for citizens to be energetic participants in city government, not just frustrated observers."
    Recent projects include: the Ranked Ballot Initiative ('11), which may influence the future of voting in
    Toronto and curating the Fourth Wall exhibit about transforming local politics in Toronto.</p>

    <p>In November 2010, Coach House books published <em>Local Motion: The Art of Civic Engagement in
    Toronto</em> co-edited by Dave, Alana Wilcox and Christina Palassio. In 2011, his TEDx video <em>The
    Antidote to Apathy</em> earned him a spot on the home page of TED.com and over 3/4 of a million views.
    Multi-partisan, fiercely optimistic and delusionally utopian, Dave embraces ideas and projects that cut
    across traditional boundaries between grassroots politics, electoral politics and the arts community. In
    his work, he attempts to weave elements of these communities together.</p>

    <p>Chosen as one of the Top Ten Activists of the year by NOW Magazine in 2000, Meslin went on to
    form the Toronto Public Space Committee. During the following five years the TPSC grew to become
    one of the most effective unfunded non-profits in Toronto, and was chosen in 2005 as the "Best
    Activist Group" by both EYE Weekly and NOW magazines.</p>

    <p>Meslin's <em>City Idol</em> project was filmed and turned into a full-length film that now airs frequently on the
    Documentary Channel. It came from coordinating a project called <em>Who Runs This Town?</em>; a campaign
    aimed at injecting some fun and creativity into the 2006 municipal elections in Toronto. The highlight
    of the project was <em>City Idol</em>, an attempt to get alienated citizens to explore and share their political ideas
    by competing for a spot on City Council in front of a live audience.</p>

    <p>Meslin's political adventures have taken him in many directions. On the inside, Meslin has been
    flown to Bogota to represent Toronto at a United Nations conference about Car-Free Cities, he's been
    appointed to Toronto's Cycling Committee and Pedestrian Committee, and has worked as an executive
    assistant at both Queen's Park and City Hall. On the outside, Meslin's rabble rousing had him labeled
    by the <em>Globe and Mail</em> as a "constant thorn" in City Council's side. He's encouraged hundreds of
    people to get involved in local activism, he's successfully derailed two major projects at City Hall that
    threatened public spaces and he's also landed himself in jail.</p>

    <p>When heâ€™s not deeply immersed in urban politics or electoral reform, Dave tours with <em>The Hidden
    Cameras</em>. Future projects could possibly include a transit riders' union, a bike store, a reality TV show,
    and hopefully another book.</p>
