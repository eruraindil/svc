    <p class="lead">Sahil is a Law Graduate from the University of
    British Columbia, and has recently left the law
    behind to pursue his dream of being a Leadership
    Development Speaker and Wellness Coach.</p>
    <p>Sahil is a connector and community builder at heart, and
    is passionate about developing people who are
    fulfilled and balanced, collaborate to support one
    another, and create meaningful contributions to
    the world around them.</p>

    <p>With leadership awards from both the University of
    Toronto and the University of British Columbia,
    Sahil has a wealth of leadership and community
    development experiences, including: working for
    the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, doing
    international development work in the Himalayas
    of Northern India, building a successful English
    Conversation Program at the University of Toronto International Student Centre,
    sitting on the UBC Olympics Steering committee and coordinating student
    engagement in Vancouver during the 2010 Winter Games, and most recently,
    working for the David Suzuki Foundation to put together their first ever community
    leadership program called Camp Suzuki.

    <p>Sahil is a trained and award-winning public speaker through Toastmasters
    International, and has presented his dynamic, fun, and interactive workshops and
    keynotes at numerous events and conferences across Canada. His favourite part
    about facilitating is fostering an experiential learning environment that enables
    participants to speak vulnerably and connect, question and reflect, share and grow,
    vision and create, and support one another to feel empowered going forward.</p>
