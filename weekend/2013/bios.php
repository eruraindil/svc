            "Dave Meslin, named one of Toronto Star's Top 12 to Watch in 2012, is an activist, journalist, community organizer and professional rabble-rouser with a focus on public space, voting reform and providing an antidote to apathy.",
            "With one foot planted firmly in the world of mainstream politics and the other foot dancing in the more vibrant universe of grassroots activism, Meslin has found ways to bring them both together and turn energy into action.",
            "Meslin's activism started with guerilla-style street antics. Painting bike lanes directly onto the street, altering billboards, and hanging pictures of Bill Cosby and Bill Clinton over &ldquo;Post no Bills&rdquo; signs were all part of his repertoire.",
            "He was named one of the Top 12 to Watch in 2012 by the Toronto Star for his actions to &ldquo;make it easier for citizens to be energetic participants in city government, not just frustrated observers.&rdquo; Recent projects include: the Ranked Ballot Initiative ('11), which may influence the future of voting in Toronto and curating the Fourth Wall exhibit about transforming local politics in Toronto.",
            "In November 2010, Coach House books published <em>Local Motion: The Art of Civic Engagement in Toronto</em> co-edited by Dave, Alana Wilcox and Christina Palassio. In 2011, his TEDx video <em>The Antidote to Apathy</em> earned him a spot on the home page of TED.com and over 3/4 of a million views. Multi-partisan, fiercely optimistic and delusionally utopian, Dave embraces ideas and projects that cut across traditional boundaries between grassroots politics, electoral politics and the arts community. In his work, he attempts to weave elements of these communities together.",
            "Chosen as one of the Top Ten Activists of the year by NOW Magazine in 2000, Meslin went on to form the Toronto Public Space Committee. During the following five years the TPSC grew to become one of the most effective unfunded non-profits in Toronto, and was chosen in 2005 as the &ldquo;Best Activist Group&rdquo; by both EYE Weekly and NOW magazines.",
            "Meslin's <em>City Idol</em> project was filmed and turned into a full-length film that now airs frequently on the Documentary Channel. It came from coordinating a project called <em>Who Runs This Town?</em>; a campaign aimed at injecting some fun and creativity into the 2006 municipal elections in Toronto. The highlight of the project was <em>City Idol</em>, an attempt to get alienated citizens to explore and share their political ideas by competing for a spot on City Council in front of a live audience.",
            "Meslin's political adventures have taken him in many directions. On the inside, Meslin has been flown to Bogota to represent Toronto at a United Nations conference about Car-Free Cities, he's been appointed to Toronto's Cycling Committee and Pedestrian Committee, and has worked as an executive assistant at both Queen's Park and City Hall. On the outside, Meslin's rabble rousing had him labeled by the <em>Globe and Mail</em> as a &ldquo;constant thorn&rdquo; in City Council's side. He's encouraged hundreds of people to get involved in local activism, he's successfully derailed two major projects at City Hall that threatened public spaces and he's also landed himself in jail.",
            "When he's not deeply immersed in urban politics or electoral reform, Dave tours with <em>The Hidden Cameras</em>. Future projects could possibly include a transit riders' union, a bike store, a reality TV show, and hopefully another book."

Through her politics and her work she has become a speaker, advocate and educator. Described as an eternal optimist by some who know her, Jarvis refuses to believe things cannot change.
