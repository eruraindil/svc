<h4>Tuesday, January 22nd, 2013 @ 10:00am-3:00pm: <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/campus/map/uc/">UC Courtyard</a></h4>
<p>Hosted by SVC every fall and winter semester, this free event showcases the excitement of volunteerism in an interactive zone that features a dynamic array of volunteer-based organizations offering meaningful volunteer placements for students that encourage self-development and provide an opportunity to make a difference in the local community. This winter semester the fair will feature a transferable skills component allowing students to recognize and promote their attributes!</p>
<!--<h3>a Celebration of Volunteerism</h3>
<p>As part of inter(act), SVC has added a celebration during the noon-hour to get people really excited about what it means to be a volunteer. In September 2010, in partnership with the CSA noon-hour series, SVC celebrated volunteerism through the power of music performed by Lost In The Trees.</p>-->
