<p>SVC defines social action as <strong>the realization of human responsibility and acting upon it for the betterment of society and the world in whole</strong>. It is a chance to not focus on individual or monetary gain, but an opportunity to contribute to the bigger picture. Social Action promotes the concept of being an engaged citizen that is intuned to current issues happening within the local and international community and acting in a positive manner to address them. With the right blend of social action and passion, any one is able to efficiently maximize their ability to make a positive impact in their world.</p>
