<p>To promote student volunteerism and social action to build a stronger community while empowering students by gaining valuable relationships, lessons, hands-on experience, and the sense of community that help develop personal and professional skills.</p>
<a id="beliefs"></a>
<h2>our beliefs</h2>
<p>It is with great pride and dignity that we stand behind our organization and its brand. SVC and its dedicated community of people believe that volunteers are one of the most essential ingredients that keep society moving forward.</p>
<p>Volunteering is a chance to develop one&apos;s experience through selfless measures while gaining new skills and opportunities. Students are at a unique time of their life when they are more open to learn new things, get their hands dirty, and experiment while having enough energy to support their everlasting ambition. Volunteers come in all different shapes, sizes, races, religions, from all sorts geographical locations and backgrounds for an unbelievable amount of reasons.</p>
<p>It is important to have people of all sorts coming together as this creates a sustainable, open-minded, and inclusive community that promotes civil responsibility as being a good neighbour and not a chore.</p>
<a id="approach"></a>
<h2>our approach</h2>
<p>Engage in student's current passions, skills, and educational program by connecting them to interest-specific meaningful volunteer placements with community-benefit organizations throughout the University of Guelph, Guelph/Wellington Area, and beyond.</p>
<p>Educate, inform, and grow student volunteers through collaboratively supplying and promoting an abundance of empowering and accessible resources, programming, and network potentials.</p>
